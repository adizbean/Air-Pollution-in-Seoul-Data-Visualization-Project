# Air-Pollution-in-Seoul-Data-Visualization-Project
Determining strategies to tackle air pollution in Seoul by understanding the city's air conditions through an analysis of air pollution data from 2017 to 2019, in order to identify the causes of poor air quality in Seoul. The analysis will be conducted over the course of one week.

## Introduction
Air pollution poses serious environmental and health risks such as respiratory deasese, cancer & acid rain.

Seoul faces persistent air pollution issues due to a mix of local and external factors. Heavy traffic, industrial activities, and high population density contribute in pollution levels.

In addition, fine dust (PM 10) from neighboring countries, especially during certain seasons, worsens the problem. The city regularly experiences days with unhealthy air quality, affecting public health and daily life.

## Problem Statement
Determining strategies to tackle air pollution in Seoul by understanding the city's air conditions through an analysis of air pollution data from 2017 to 2019, in order to identify poor air quality factors in Seoul. The analysis will be conducted over the course of one week.

## Project Overview
This project is a group work focusing on air pollution in Seoul. As a data analyst, I conducted data analysis using Python and various libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, along with time series and forecasting techniques to model air pollution trends over time. The analysis aims to understand the patterns of air pollution level changes in Seoul, identify key contributing factors, and predict future pollution conditions using appropriate forecasting models. The visualizations created help convey insights clearly and in an easily understandable manner.
